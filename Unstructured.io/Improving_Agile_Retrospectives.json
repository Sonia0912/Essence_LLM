It is one of those big, lavish hotels, which has, in order to better meet the demands of its guests, placed six elevators next to one another. This businessman waits and waits, but the elevator doesn\u2019t come. The problem is that he is standing so close to the elevator that he fails to notice that some of the other elevators have been at his floor for a long time. Were he to take two paces backward, he would reach his goal more quickly.",

But all of these activities do not solve his real problem: He is getting slower and slower. If he took the time to do a retrospective, he would find out that sharpening his ax would be a good idea, or even better, buying a chainsaw. The same concept often applies to our work life.

When a family sits down to dinner and talks about the day\u2014the children talking about school and the parents talking about their experiences\u2014that is a retrospective. Looking back over the life\u2019s work of an artist, author, or director is also a retrospective. As part of a retrospective like this, various events take place at which a range of the artist\u2019s work is shown. All the important pieces are collected in a single place to provide a complete picture of the artist\u2019s work. This makes it possible to get a good overall impression and affords the opportunity of comparing and contrasting the different works of art. This would be impossible if we had access to only one example. Only by getting the overall impression is it possible to see the whole and have the opportunity to speculate about why the artist did one thing and not another.",

We can learn from both successes as well as failures; good things can often be made even better. You could compare it to evolution: things that haven\u2019t worked become extinct, but everything that contributes to the preservation of the species is kept and developed further. In the end, each of these adaptations is nothing more than an experiment, because you never know for sure what the result will be.

You\u2019ve created an overall picture and common understanding of the period under consideration and have also gained some insight into the various events that took place. At this point, most of the team will already have some ideas about what to improve or try out next. So the team\u2019s next task is to choose one or two actions and to agree on how to implement them. This also ensures that the team will have the time to implement its decisions. After all, the daily workload still must be done. Trying to implement too many changes at once can lead to problems. It also makes it more difficult to tell later which experiments actually had an effect.",
