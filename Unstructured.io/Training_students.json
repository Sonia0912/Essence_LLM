The product to build was a specialized Twitter client, with instructors re\ufb01ning its requirements throughout the course. We observed over a hundred students divided into teams of approximately \ufb01ve members each. To support agile collaboration and self-tracking, we provided students with a comprehensive software development environment consisting solely of open- source tools. Before commencing their cooperation, we encour- aged students to engage in team-building activities to foster better mutual understanding. We adopted the Essence approach to instill an agile mindset and facilitated retrospectives tailored to the students\u2019 needs. Key \ufb01ndings include the effective use of the adaptable Scrum framework with support from the Essence approach to agile teamwork. Although the constraint of using exclusively on-premises open-source software tools posed some challenges for the students, all produced data and documents were accessible for inspection by the instructors. Additionally, the utilization of a product quality model and team maturity model proved valuable for evaluating and comparing the teams. Notably, all teams successfully completed their tasks within the designated timeframe.",

Agile methods and practices can also help students develop valuable soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability. Practicing agile, they should learn how to work effectively with a product owner and other developers, respond to changing requirements, and aiming at continuously improving their work processes. Although there are several agile methods, two are especially outstanding: Scrum [21] and Extreme Programming [3]. The former is the most popular, be- cause it enforces the major Agile principles of iterative, value- based, incremental delivery by frequently gathering customer feedback and embracing requirements change. The latter is also well known, as it introduced a set of agile best practices that can be easily be applied and exploited by students, such as pair programming, the collective property of code, requirements as user stories, etc. An important value fostered by the agile vision is that the process is less important than individuals and interactions. We interpret this value suggesting the students that they can choose the best practices to use",

For instance, in [9], the authors describe their experiences teaching agile software development to computer science students and provide some recommendations for instructors; in [15] we found the de- scription of a course on agile methodologies taught to software engineering students analyzing their personalities and attitudes to teamwork; and in [17] there is a discussion of how the use of collaborative practices needs some maturity by the stu- dents. A paper exploiting Essence during an academic course project work is [13]; this paper discusses the dif\ufb01culties of adopting Essence in the context of an undergraduate software engineering course. We searched for papers concerning team building in a university context: we found [14], which suggests an approach on how to integrate team building into university courses including agile teamwork.",

The assignment of roles is a critical team building activity: to decide the roles, the teams were requested to play a game of Scrumble. This is a serious game in which a Scrum process is simulated, including also a concept of managing technical debt. A game of Scrumble can be played either in presence or online [5]. During each round of the game, the players took on different roles, such as Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team members. The Product Owner was responsible for introducing the user stories and prioritize the work, while the Scrum Master was the coach explaining the Scrum process and ensuring that the team is following the rules. The retrospective performed at the end the game was based on a GQM evaluation which helped the team to choose which people could cover which roles in the real project.",
