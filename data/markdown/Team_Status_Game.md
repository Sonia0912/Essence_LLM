# Team Status Game (Beta Release)

**Duration:** 10-20 Minutes, during the sprint retrospective

**Participants:** The team ("pigs only")

**Expected outcome:**
- Shared assessment of the team\'s status
- Prioritized improvement plan

## Step 1
Each team member chooses one of the team level cards
(indicate the number).

If everyone chooses the same card, proceed to step 2.

If not, starting with the outliers, each person explains their reasoning
for selecting a particular state. After the discussion, a re-vote is
held.

UNANIMITY IS REQUIRED TO PROCEED

## Step 2
Once the card is identified, refer to the checklist on the
card. Each team member secretly chooses a number equal to or less than
the number of checkboxes on the card. Reveal the numbers, and starting
with the lowest number, each member identifies one checkbox on the card
that, in their opinion, has been completed.

IF THERE IS UNANIMITY, the selected checkbox is marked, and everyone
reduces their number by 1, continuing the process.

IF THERE IS NO UNANIMITY, discuss whether the checkbox can be considered
completed. If consensus is reached, proceed as in the previous case.
Otherwise, the box is considered "half-marked." Only those who voted in
favor *initially* reduce their number of votes, and the process
continues.

Once all team members have 0 votes, move to the next phase.

## Step 3
If all the checkboxes have been marked, this means the team
is actually at the next stage. Move to the next card and repeat from the
beginning.

## Step 4
Review all the items that are \"half-marked,\" meaning
desirable conditions that have not been fully achieved. Through a quick
brainstorming session, the team proposes an improvement plan to address
them. These proposals should be considered **high priority**.

## Step 5
Finally, review the remaining items. Conduct a quick
brainstorming session to come up with an improvement plan for them.
These proposals should be considered **medium priority**.
