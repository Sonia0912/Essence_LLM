# What’s so special about the Internet of Things?
Internet of Things touches all kinds of products, services, functionality
All levels of complexity
- from very simple software running on basic sensors and other simple devices through to
- the high-performance, highly reliable, highly governed, secure, resilient, scalable systems needed to process, analyze and respond to the vast amounts of data they produce and
- everything else in between.
Internet of Things: Cloud Computing, Mobile Internet, Big Data, Modern Manufacturing.

# The Internet of Things needs everything
The Internet of Things doesn’t lack methods.
A major player needs all of this at the same time.
Needs a multitude of methods.

# And New Domain-Specific Practices are needed
Internet of Things needs: methods for agile, practices for mobile, methods for small apps, practices for human out-of-the-loop, methods for complex system of systems, methods for system engineering, practices for distributed systems, methods for waterfall.

# Summary of IoT needs
A single vendor needs a multitude of methods
- Teams need to be able to select their own method from a library of practices
- Methods need a new user-experience - developers don’t read books
- Methods need to focus on the essence - 5% of what an expert knows
- Methods need to guide in every day usage, not guide by reading a book
- The method needs to help you monitor progress & health of the project

# Let’s look at Methods for Agile at Scale
Methods for Agile at scale: SAFe, Scaled Professional Scrum, Disciplined Agile Delivery, Large Scale Scrum.
They are all monolithic - non modular
They have a lot in common (but you can’t easily see it)
They all have unique own prac1ces, but you cannot mix and match prac1ces from them
If you select one, you are in a “Method Prison” controlled by the guru of that Method
And, there are many more other methods that also are monolit

**Method prisons are not smart**

# Start getting a Common Ground
What is a Common Ground?
- It includes elements that every method has, what every method produces, what you do always, etc.
- It is a starting point to understand software engineering
Before 2014: No common ground
After 2014: A Standard Common Ground

# There is a standard Common Ground: Essence
For the first time in the 60+ year history of software engineering, we have got a Common Ground
Kernel + Language = Essence
Kernel has the essential things to work with, to do and competencies you need.
The Language is a visual language, it's simple and intuitive.
Essence is the common ground.

# Essence is the common ground to build Practices and Methods upon
A practice is a repeatable approach to doing something with a specific purpose in mind. A practice provides a systematic and verifiable way of addressing a particular aspect of the work at hand.
A method is a composition of Practices. Methods are enactable.

# The Method Architecture
There are around 250 identified practices including, for instance, use cases, use stories, features, components.
There are probably more than 100,000 methods incl. for instance SADT, Booch, OMT, RUP, CMMI, XP, Scrum, Lean, Kanban.

# Then Add Practices on Top of Essence
Essence makes Methods Modular - not Monolithic
A method is made of practices.

# Imagine a Practice Library
The practice library is made of methods like your existing practices, SAFe, Disciplined Agile Delivery and Scaled Professional Scrum.
And you select the practices you like and ignore the ones you don’t need to create your own method to get ﬂexibility.

# Mix and Match Practices to Empower your Teams
Team’s build their way-of-working on top of pre-deﬁned common ground and in-line with organiza1onal principles and policies.

# The Method SAFe4.0 Essentialized
SAFe 4.0 practices are built on top of generic practices, which are built on top of the Kernel.
SAFe 4.0 practices value stream coordination, portfolio practices, program practices and infrastructure practices.

# Approach to Reuse Across Practices
"Practices" that reuse Practice Assets: IoT Project Shaping, IoT Project Initiation.

# Essence Usages
Essence has Two Major Usages: Practice Descriptions and Practice Application.

# The Major Impact of Essence
The Major Impacts of Essence are in Industrial Scale Engineering and in a Learning Organization.

# Essence Value Proposition
While preparing:
- We have a Common Ground
- All methods can be modularized
- Build Practice Libraries with practices from many providers
- Safely Mix and Match practices best for you
- Easy to compose team’s own ways-of- working
- Harvest and share the latest practices
- Just what you need - the Essence
- Easy to present and train, learn and apply
- Easy to compare and contrast
- Easy to get team’s started
- Easy to continuously improve and keep up to date
While working:
- Active guidance and gamification
- Monitor progress and health avoiding catastrophic failures
- Understand where you are and where you’re going
- Practice independent governance practices
- Grow your way-of-working as you grow your team

# Essentialization moves us to...
Essentialization moves us to Industrial Scale Engineering and a Leaming Organization.
Industrial Scale Engineering:
- Systematically address the methods to allow for dramatic efficiency and quality improvements through tooling and techniques
- Right size the applied methods to fit the problems at hand with minimum overhead, which shortens time to market
- Application of many engineering practices for:
    - requirements such as use cases, features, user stories
    - design and architecture patterns, for developing components and services
    - testing complex, distributed systems
    - encouraging systematic reuse
    - helping engineers code with confidence
    - architectural concerns such as concurrency, security, user experience, micro-services, and data protection
- Application of practices with broader architectural concerns such as enterprise architecture, product-line architecture, service-oriented architecture and the architecture of systems of systems
- Working systematically instead of relying on heroics
Leaming Organization:
- Common language / common culture
    - Create your own kernel - if needed
    - Establish shared common ground for all teams
    - Exchange and share practices and experiences
- Increase the competency of every individual
    - Building practice libraries accessible to everyone
    - Continuously improve
    - Nurture communities of practices
    - Share practice
    - Directed coaching
    - Practice-based accreditation
- Create winning teams
    - Plug and play methods and practices
    - Track progress and health
    - Lightweight, practical governance
- More competent people will
    - develop better software faster and cheaper with happier customers
    - innovate more effectively

# The Future is around the corner
Less than 20% of sogware development work is really crea1ve
80% is “no-brain” work following well-known paierns
It is expected that at the least 50% of the “no-brain” work can be taken over by intelligent agents (expert systems)
Developers can be liberated from some “no-brain” work to really innovate instead of solving the similar problem over and over again
Prac1ces are perfect candidates for intelligent agents
We have extensive experience in designing intelligent agents through Waypointer

# Early Adopters’ Expectations
- you can do twice as good a job…
- you can do the job twice as fast…
- you can do the job with half the people…
- you can do all that and still make your customer happier...
What choice do we have?
Welcome to the future!
