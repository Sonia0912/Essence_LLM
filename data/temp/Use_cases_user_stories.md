Scaling up, scaling out, zooming in – what is that?
Use cases scale in several dimensions:

Scaling up:



Though Use-Case 2.0 is designed for small teams and small projects, it scales without changing the fundamentals to large organizations and large projects.
# Scaling out:

Though Use-Case 2.0 starts with requirements, it scales to many other lifecycle activities such as analysis, design, code, test, user experience, business design, etc.
# Zooming in:
• Use-Case 2.0 allows you to be as light as you want, focusing on the essentials only, or to zoom in with more and more detail for systems such as telecom or defense systems or more regulated systems such as life-critical systems.

What made use cases so popular?
• They effectively communicate what a system is supposed to do
• They place the requirements into the context of a specific user’s goals
• They are the test cases
• They are the starting point for the design of effective user experiences
• They ‘drive’ the development through design and code

To get to the heart of what a system must do, you should focus on who, (or what) will use it, and then look at what the system must do for them to help them achieve something useful.

# Good Use Cases
• Focus on Value
• Place the system and the requirements in context
• Package the requirements up into meaningful sub-sets
• Tell the story of what the system will do
• Bring the Business and IT closer together
• Facilitate both release planning and iteration planning
• Are easy for everybody to understand
• Can be identified and outlined very quickly

Why do we need use case 2.0?
# • To correct some of the common misunderstandings:
Use-cases are lightweight not heavy-weight
Use-cases are stories not functions
Use-cases are simple not complicated
Use-cases are for all types of development not just green field application development
• To re-focus on the essentials
• To better support innovations and improvements such as test-driven development, Kanban, and Scrum

A use case is still a use case
# A use case is all the ways of using a system to achieve a particular goal for a particular user.
• Use cases can be shown in UML diagrams
• Use cases are described as narratives
– Which tell the story of how the system and its users work together to achieve a particular goal

Slicing up use cases to drive the development
A Use Case
A Use-Case Slice
# S
Is described by a set of structured stories in the form of:

# Is
A use-case narrative containing flows and special requirements
And a set of matching Test Cases
Use-Case 2.0 / 0 - Introduction

Is created by selecting one or more stories for implementation
• …, acts as a placeholder for all the work required to complete the implementation of the stories
• …, and evolves to include the equivalent slices through design, implementation and test.

# Use case
Use-Case 2.0 / 0 - Introduction
# S
# • A use case is:
A sequence of actions a system performs that yields an observable result of value to a particular user.
That specific behaviour of a system, which participates in a collaboration with a user to deliver something of value for that user.
The smallest unit of activity that provides a meaningful result to the user.
The context for a set of related requirements.
# • To understand a use case we tell stories.
The stories cover both how to successfully achieve the goal and how to handle any problems that occur on the way.

# Use case states
• Goal Established: when the goal of the use case has been established.
• Story Structure Understood: when the structure of the use-case narrative has been understood enough for the team to start work identifying and implementing the first use-case slices.
• Simplest Story Fulfilled: when the system fulfils the simplest story that allows a user to achieve the goal.
• Sufficient Stories Fulfilled: when the system fulfils enough of the stories to provide a usable solution.
• All Stories Fulfilled: when the system fulfils all the stories told by the use case.

# Use case slice
# • Use-case slices:
Enable use cases to be broken up into smaller, independently deliverable units of work.
Enable the requirements contained in a set of use cases to be ordered, prioritized and addressed in parallel.
Link the different system models (requirements, analysis, design, implementation and test) used in use- case driven development.

# Use case slice states
• Scoped: when it has been scoped and the extent of the stories covered has been clarified.
• Prepared: when the slice has been prepared by enhancing the narrative and test cases to clearly define what it means to successfully implement the slice.
• Analyzed: when the slice has been analyzed so its impact on the components of the system is understood and the pieces affected are ready for coding and developer testing.

Implemented: when the software system has been enhanced to implement the slice and the slice is ready for testing.
• Verified: and finally when the slice has been verified as done and is ready for inclusion in a release.

# Summary: Introducing Use-Case 2.0
• Use cases are still use cases
• They provide context for our requirements
• We only model what is important
• We slice our use cases to drive the development
• We eliminate waste by using the lightest level of detail
• We include test cases (as part of the use case) to define done
• We use cards and backlogs to support agile ways-of-working
• We add detail to cope with out-sourcing and off-shoring
• We apply the techniques recursively to handle large projects, programs and business change

# Summary: Use Case 2.0 -- Distinctive Features

It helps you quickly understand the big picture
• As light as you want it to be
• Enabling incremental delivery

It’s not just about requirements, it’s for the whole lifecycle

It’s also for non-functional requirements

It’s also for embedded software

It’s not just for software development – it’s for business development as well
• Scaling to meet your needs – zooming in, scaling out and scaling up
