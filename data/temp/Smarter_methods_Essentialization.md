What’s so special about the Internet of Things?

Internet of Things touches all kinds of products, services, functionality
# • All levels of complexity
– from very simple software running on basic sensors and other simple devices through to
– the high-performance, highly reliable, highly governed, secure, resilient, scalable systems needed to process, analyze and respond to the vast amounts of data they produce and
– everything else in between.

# Computing '\ .
# Mobile

# Modern Manufacturing
Creating winning teams.
The Internet of Things needs everything
• The Internet of Things doesn’t lack methods.

What aren’t needed are new management practices.
Creating winning teams.
# Summary of IoT needs
# A single vendor needs a multitude of methods
• Teams need to be able to select their own method from a library of practices
• Methods need a new user-experience – developers don’t read books
• Methods need to focus on the essence – 5% of what an expert knows
• Methods need to guide in every day usage, not guide by reading a book
– The method needs to help you monitor progress & health of the project

They are all monolithic – non modular
They have a lot in common (but you can’t easily see it)
They all have unique own prac1ces, but you cannot mix and match prac1ces from them
If you select one, you are in a “Method Prison” controlled by the guru of that Method
• And, there are many more other methods that also are monolit

Essence is the common ground to build Practices and Methods upon

# Essence Value Proposition
While preparing
• We have a Common Ground
• All methods can be modularized
• Build Practice Libraries with practices from many providers
• Safely Mix and Match practices best for you
• Easy to compose team’s own ways-of- working
• Harvest and share the latest practices

Just what you need – the Essence
• Easy to present and train, learn and apply
• Easy to compare and contrast
• Easy to get team’s started
• Easy to continuously improve and keep up to date
# While working
Active guidance and gamification
Monitor progress and health avoiding catastrophic failures
Understand where you are and where you’re going
Practice independent governance practices
Grow your way-of-working as you grow your team
Creating winning teams.
Essentialization moves us to….
# Industrial Scale Engineering
# A Leaming Organizaidon

Systematically address the methods to allow for dramatic efficiency and quality improvements through tooling and techniques

Right size the applied methods to fit the problems at hand with minimum overhead, which shortens time to market

Application of many engineering practices for
–
requirements such as use cases, features, user stories
–
design and architecture patterns, for developing components and services
–
testing complex, distributed systems
–
encouraging systematic reuse
–
helping engineers code with confidence
–
architectural concerns such as concurrency, security, user experience, micro-services, and data protection

Application of practices with broader architectural concerns such as enterprise architecture, product-line architecture, service-oriented architecture and the architecture of systems of systems
• Working systematically instead of relying on heroics




# Common language / common culture
–
Create your own kernel – if needed
–
Establish shared common ground for all teams
–
Exchange and share practices and experiences
# Increase the competency of every individual
–
Building practice libraries accessible to everyone
–
Continuously improve
–
Nurture communities of practices
–
Share practice
–
Directed coaching
–
Practice-based accreditation
Create winning teams
–
Plug and play methods and practices
–
Track progress and health
–
Lightweight, practical governance
# More competent people will
–
develop better software faster and cheaper with happier customers
–
innovate more effectively

6. What is the Value Proposition?
7. Next: It is Futurized
8. The Expectation Today
Creating winning teams.
The Future is around the corner

Less than 20% of sogware development work is really crea1ve
• 80% is “no-brain” work following well-known paierns

It is expected that at the least 50% of the “no-brain” work can be taken over by intelligent agents (expert systems)
• Developers can be liberated from some “no-brain” work to really innovate instead of solving the similar problem over and over again
• Prac1ces are perfect candidates for intelligent agents
• We have extensive experience in designing intelligent agents through Waypointer
