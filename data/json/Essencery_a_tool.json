One at- tempt at creating a common ground in the area of software engineering method- ologies has been the Essence Theory of Software Engineering, which can be con- sidered a method-agnostic project management tool for software engineering. Es- sence supports the use of any development practices and provides a framework for building a suitable method for any software engineering context. However, Essence presently suffers from low practitioner adoption that is partially consid- ered to be caused by a lack of proper tooling. In this paper, we present Essencery, a tool for essentializing software engineering methods and practices using the Essence graphical syntax. Essencery aims to facilitate adoption of Essence among potential future users. We present an empirical evaluation of the tool by means of a qualitative, quasi-formal experiment and, based on the experiment, confirm that the tool is easy to use and useful for its intended purpose.",

This is perhaps even more im- portant for Essence given its already resource-intensive adoption. To this end, e.g. Gra- ziotin & Abrahamsson [6] have presented SematAcc to make the Essence kernel easier to utilize. However, further tooling covering other aspects of Essence such as graph- drawing is still needed. The existing Essence Practice Workbench comes with a steep learning curve and is not open source. While pen-and-paper and generic digital drawing tools offer reasonable alternatives, dedicated drawing tool can offer various advantages over general purpose alternatives. E.g. using a dedicated drawing tool, graphs can be far easier to modify and compose, and can offer more for communication purposes.",

PU and PEoU, then, result in a decision to either accept or reject the technology. In addition, Davis [3] established a link between PEoU and PU: the easier the system is to use, the more useful it often consequently is.
