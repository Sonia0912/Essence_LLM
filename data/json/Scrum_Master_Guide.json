        "text": "The Scrum framework was conceived in the late 1980s to counteract the formal, rigid, and stagnating software development methodologies prevalent at the time. The Scrum framework was formalized in the mid-1990s and its founders, Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber, were instrumental in the creation of the Agile Manifesto and the subsequent spread of the Agile development movement. Scrum quickly became the most popular Agile framework, with huge adoption in both small businesses and the enterprise world. Part of the popularity of Scrum is its adaptability. The Scrum Guide keeps getting updated every few years to reflect current thinking and practices. Scrum.org also offers an impressive array of Scrum-related resources and certifications, one of which we'll be addressing in this book.",

The book consists of two parts. In the first five chapters, we will cover the Scrum fundamentals. The theory and principles of Scrum will be digested, before moving on to cover the Scrum Team, Events, and Artifacts. The second part will focus on more practical knowledge, by examining practices and methods used by Scrum Teams in the real world. We will learn how to plan and estimate in Scrum, how to monitor progress and deal with different situations within the Sprint, best practices for infrastructure and testing, and how to manage eventualities such as technical debt or remote working. Every chapter closes with a short quiz to reinforce the knowledge gained.",

In 2000 and 2001, a small group of these influencers met up to discuss these methods and techniques. The unifying theme behind this effort was a desire to be able to quickly deliver working software to end users and to get rapid feedback on the software's impact and scope. In the forthcoming years, methodologies developed under this philosophy came to be known under the umbrella term of Agile.",

Two of these visionaries were Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland. They came up with an Agile framework called Scrum, which was based on using the scientific method of empiricism, rather than strictly following a pre-defined plan. Scrum embraces Agile, not only because it was created by two of the people involved in the creation of the Agile Manifesto, but also because the Scrum values are actively derived from Agile principles (see Scrum Values meet Agile Principles in the Further reading section). In fact, most organizations that have adopted Agile methods use Scrum (see The State of Agile in the Further reading section).",

It introduces a number of rules, milestones, and checkpoints that must be adhered to, regardless of the underlying development process. The Scrum framework can be used to contain a varied number of popular development methodologies, processes, or techniques, as per the organization's working practices. Scrum doesn't tell us how to perform our work, it just sets up a container within which to perform it. We can use whichever development methods and design or release processes we like, within Scrum. As long as these abide by the Agile and Scrum principles, it is absolutely fine to do so.",

Sometimes, we may have to deliver Feature A again, but this time working better or faster or having fixed a bug in it. The point is, each iteration should offer something more than the previous one. This chunk of software and functionality that each iteration adds to the system is called an Increment. In Scrum, an increment is not randomly produced but is intended to achieve a specific goal, to deliver the desired functionality or to fix a specific problem.

As with every other tools, you need to decide if its use fits your needs. I advocate Scrum and I use it most of the time, but I once worked on a project where Kanban provided the most fitting approach, due to that project's special circumstances. Some of my fellow Scrum Masters and PSM members have occasionally found that using Lean tool-sets, such as 5S, or applying XP techniques, may suit a specific project's needs better.

In 2009, Schwaber decided to go his own way and created Scrum.org. These two still remain the only valid and authentic Scrum organizations. They both offer Scrum-related certifications. Scrum.org offers PSM certification at two levels: I and II for a fundamental and advanced understanding of Scrum, respectively.",

At this point, you may be thinking Hold on, Scrum is a practical, agile approach to software development, so why should I care about theory? The simple answer here is that Scrum isn't a step-by- step process. It doesn't prescribe that you should follow step 1 and then step 2 and then maybe step 3 or 4. Scrum is a process framework. It tells us what we should value, what is important, sets out some rules, and gives us directions on how to apply these rules to achieve the things we value. Without knowing the underlying philosophy and principles, it is impossible to follow the directions Scrum sets out for us. So, with this in mind, this chapter is about the philosophy of Scrum, the empirical approach it is based on, its values, and its principles. We will cover the following topics in particular:",

Empiricism is often contrasted with rationalism, another theory of knowledge that regards reason as the chief source and standard of knowledge. In other words, rationalism determines truth based on the adoption of and adherence to intellectual templates and standards. Empiricism, on the other hand, determines truth based on the results of experimentation, evaluation of evidence, and its alignment with a perceived useful outcome.",

Any experienced software professional can tell us that doubling the number of developers does not equate to a doubling of productivity. But why is that so? The reason is that, unlike widget-making, software development is a non-deterministic process. What that means is that following the same process, techniques, and standards will not necessarily produce the same results every single time. So, if Alice wants to double her team's productivity, she will probably need to hire some new developers, re-train some of the existing ones, re-assign some others, or apply different permutations of similar corrective actions. She will need to be monitoring the productivity effect of each of these actions and she'll need to be doing that constantly until she reaches the desired productivity increase. In short, Alice will need to follow an empirical approach in order to succeed.",

The software system's architecture and high-level design would be established in advance by the technical lead or solution architect and then developers would implement the design and deliver the software.

However, as software technologies began to expand and the internet era dawned, it became painfully obvious that this model was not viable. Software became ubiquitous in people's lives, competition for software products increased, and clients started to crave flexibility, adaptability, and bigger involvement in the products they were paying the software industry to create. Scrum offered a new development and delivery model and the first thing to change was the structure of the software team, by identifying three distinct roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Developers). The other thing that set a Scrum Team apart was certain characteristics that the team possessed. Let's talk about these characteristics for a minute.",

        "text": "The Scrum Master role is one of the most misunderstood concepts of Scrum. Many people find it hard to understand the value of someone with no apparent authority or influence on the product or the team. However, the Scrum Master role is crucial for a team's success. The Scrum Master is often referred to as a servant-leader, and this is for good reason. They are the person who ensures that the team is working well together, that impediments to progress are quickly removed, and that the team is moving efficiently toward its goal. They interact with the rest of the Scrum Team but also with the organization and stakeholders. In this section, we'll learn about the things a Scrum Master should do, the things they shouldn't do, and we'll answer some commonly asked questions about this role.",

The credibility of the Scrum Master may also be undermined, as they are supposed to be protecting the Developers from outside interference, which may be interpreted to be for personal reasons if the Scrum Master is also a Developer. As a rule of thumb, assigning the role of Scrum Master and Developer to the same person should be done as a last resort.",

They are well within their rights to provide a product roadmap and set milestones and goals. For instance, it's perfectly reasonable for a Product Owner to say, we need to deliver features X and Y within 6 months, to hit the market before a competitor's rival product. What they must not do, however, is to pressurize the team to increase their effort or change their way of working in order to reach that deadline. It is up to the Developers to plan their work in the way they see fit and to raise concerns when planning. For example, in looking to plan sprints in such a way that the required features are delivered within a deadline, the team may identify the need for adding more developers to it. This should then be raised with the Scrum Master as a potential impediment. Also, everyone should keep in mind that Scrum is an empirical process. Every Sprint helps increase our understanding of the domain and of our capacity to deliver working software. Therefore, deciding 6 months in advance whether some features will be delivered by that time is not a pragmatic or sensible approach and is not aligned with the Agile principles (see What is Agile software development? section in Chapter 1, Introduction to Scrum). It is the Scrum Master's responsibility to ensure that this is well understood by everyone.",

This can still happen between Scrum Team Developers with consent, but it cannot be mandated. It may only happen organically with the team's input and acceptance. So the team may decide that a single person will be doing all testing work. This is fine, as long as the whole team has discussed and agreed to it. Self-management means that such decisions are not dictated by people outside the group. Furthermore, the Developers own all the work collectively, even if there is one person doing it.

If the product is frontend heavy, for example, then having just one team member with frontend skills will ensure other members without the necessary level of knowledge will be required to perform more complex frontend tasks more often. This is not a bad thing in itself, but it will impact the team's velocity (see qs) and may tempt the organization to call for external expert help or make staff changes, which will gravely disrupt the team.

We call such an iteration a Sprint. A Sprint is a container event, as all the other Scrum Events take place within the duration and context of a Sprint. The ultimate purpose of the Sprint is to have the Developers produce an Increment. An Increment is a piece of working and potentially shippable software that leverages previous Increments. We'll talk more about what this means in a subsequent section. However, the Sprint also provides space and time for all the other Scrum Events, where the whole Scrum Team comes together to plan, inspect, and adapt. A good way to visualize the Sprint is as a cyclical process, demarcated by other events, as illustrated in the following diagram:",

A specification is an agreement between us and our customer about how our system should function.

It then becomes easy to verify that our code enacts this behavior. This can take place either manually or by automated scripts.

Therefore, it is advisable that developers or stakeholders who wish to add or change items on the Product Backlog do so under the guidance and approval of the Product Owner. Without interfering or confusing changes, the Product Backlog is the single source of truth for the product's requirements and planned work.

My experience suggests that 10% of the Sprint's length usually provides adequate time for refinement in most cases. I would also strongly advise that dedicated time is set apart each Sprint for backlog refinement with the participation of the whole Scrum Team. This should be done preferably in multiple meetings based on the Sprint's length. For example, in a 2-week sprint (10 working days), I would try to set apart two half-day sessions, one each week, for backlog refinement. This time should be taken into account when the developers create the Sprint Backlog (see the Creating and managing the Sprint Backlog section) and when they estimate their work capacity for the Sprint.",

The Product Owner will make suggestions as to which items should go in the Sprint Backlog, but the developers will decide based on their estimation of the work needed for each item and their own capacity to deliver work within the Sprint. Often, if the Product Owner is very insistent on including certain items in the Sprint, the developers may exclude other items of equal size or complexity from the Sprint Backlog so that they can accommodate the high-priority item.

        "text": "The first thing we must do before we start the estimation process is choose an estimation scale for our story points. The lower end of the scale should represent items that take the least effort or are the least complex. The high end of the scale should represent items that take the most effort or are the most complex. Many Scrum Teams use the Fibonacci series (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on). Others use a T-shirt size scale (S, M, L, XL, and XXL). I have worked with a team that used fruit to denote the complexity of a task (cherries were the simplest ones, while pineapples were the most complex). Some organizations tend to use a modified Fibonacci series (1/2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, and 100) as it's more flexible and readable. Whichever scale you decide to use, it's a good idea to include a value for items that the estimator thinks cannot be estimated or completed within a reasonable time, or to an expected quality. The question mark (?) and infinity (\u221e ) symbols are normally used for that purpose. We would normally mark our chosen scale as a deck of cards and allocate a deck to each developer. A typical deck would look something like this:",

Some Scrum Teams choose the easiest item in their Product Backlog and assign it the lowest estimate value. I don't agree with this approach as it is subjective and temporaneous; it creates a moving baseline that reflects the current items in the backlog instead of a generic and objective representation of effort and complexity. Instead, I suggest that developers think of the simplest item they can think of for the business domain and technologies they are working in.",

So, now, we have two baselines: one for the low-end estimates and one for mid-range estimates. The reason for having two baselines is that it's easier and more accurate to say that an item is two or three times more difficult than another than saying that it's 10 times more difficult.

This is not true. The key here is understanding what potentially releasable software means. It doesn't necessarily mean fully functional or even user-facing software, though some people perceive it that way. It just means Done software that can be released to the stakeholders if the Product Owner decides it adds value to do so. A skeleton web application (commonly known as scaffolding) that simply prints hello world on screen, is potentially releasable software if it meets the definition of Done. Whether it will be worth releasing to the stakeholders is a different matter. The point is, to put it in simple terms, that the Sprint produces software that works and helps accomplish the Sprint Goal. If the Sprint Goal is to create a basic website that we can enhance later, then our hello world site is a perfectly good increment.",

Do we add the 8 story-points we originally estimated for the incomplete item to our Sprint's total of story-points? There are differing opinions on the matter. Some Scrum Teams take the strict approach: if an item is not completed (or is causing an increment to be rejected), the Developers should not be credited with the story-points for that item. I find this a bit harsh and unrepresentative of the actual work performed and value delivered. I tend to prefer a different allocation of story-points: after the item has been re-estimated, the Developers are credited with the median points between the original and re-estimated value. Consider our previous example. The incomplete item was originally estimated to represent 8 story-points (on a Fibonacci scale). It was placed back on the Product Backlog and re-estimated to be 3 story-points, since much of the work for it has already been done. The Developers will be credited with 5 story-points (1, 3, 5, 8) worth of work. This is a fairer reflection of the work the Developers already performed for that item and helps establish a more accurate velocity reading in the long term.",

How can we have dozens of developers working on the product, all using Scrum? The solution to this is actually simple: we can partition the product work in separate but related workstreams, or product components, and create a Scrum Team to work on delivering each component. Each team will have its own product backlog and will work like any independent Scrum Team does. The teams will have to regularly coordinate to ensure they don't get in each other's way and that they all work towards the same goal.",
